# Microweight

Microweight.jl has functions that allow the user to adjust weights for microdata
files including social science surveys such as the *American Community Survey*,
public use microdata files of pseudo tax returns, and other similar files.

It has two main goals: reweighting, and geo-weighting.

## Reweighting

## Geoweighting
